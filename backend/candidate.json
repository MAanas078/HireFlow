    "notes": "A strong candidate with relevant projects and skills. However, the lack of professional experience may be a concern. His academic background is not directly in computer science, which could be a factor.  The projects demonstrate a good understanding of full-stack development using technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB.  The LeetCode achievements show dedication to problem-solving. His participation in Hackathons is a plus. Consider whether the lack of direct CS education and professional experience outweighs his demonstrated skills and strong portfolio.",
